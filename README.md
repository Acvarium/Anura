In 'Anura. SlowMo Frog,' players take control of a hungry frog. Similar to the classic snake game, players maneuver using directional controls, but with a twistâ€”pressing a button extends the long, sticky tongue, slowing down time.

With time on their side, players must carefully guide the tongue's direction, strategically capturing flies while avoiding dangerous insects and obstacles. As players progress, the game becomes increasingly challenging, requiring quick reflexes and precise timing to outmaneuver new threats and achieve high scores.

With its unique gameplay mechanics and charmingly quirky protagonist, 'Anura. SlowMo Frog' offers a fresh take on a classic formula, promising hours of addictive and entertaining gameplay."
